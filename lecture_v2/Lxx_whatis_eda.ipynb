    "**First**, *Formulate Questions* - Define objectives and questions to be answered from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we don't know what we are looking for, we are unlikely to find something interesting.\n",
    "- Questions guide the analysis and help focus on relevant aspects of the data.\n",

    "### Four objectives of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discover Patterns\n",

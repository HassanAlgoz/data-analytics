    "[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and integrates closely with pandas data structures.\n",

    "Matplotlib features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create publication quality plots.\n",
    "- Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.\n",
    "- Customize visual style and layout.\n",
    "- Export to many file formats.\n",
    "- Embed in JupyterLab and Graphical User Interfaces.\n",
    "- Use a rich array of third-party packages built on Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn categorizes its plots into the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relational plots\n",
    "- Distribution plots\n",
    "- Categorical plots\n",
    "- Regression plots\n",
